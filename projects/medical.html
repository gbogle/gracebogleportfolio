                <h3>Research Overview</h3>
                <p>This project focused on understanding users' medical histories and how these experiences influence their interactions with a prospective digital medical portal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="confidentiality-notice">
                <p><em>Due to the confidential nature of client-facing deliverables, I cannot present specific project details or contents. However, I'm excited to share my research journey and the valuable skills I developed through this opportunity.</em></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Research Participants</h2>
            <p>I designed a comprehensive research approach that combined quantitative and qualitative methods to capture both broad usage patterns and deep user insights.</p>
            
            <ul class="participant-list">
                <li><strong>10+ ethnographic interview participants</strong> - for in-depth behavioral insights</li>
                <li><strong>200+ online survey respondents</strong> - for statistical validation</li>
                <li><strong>Recruitment criteria:</strong> Demographics, portal interaction levels, and usage patterns</li>
            </ul>
            

            <h2>Project Preparation (2 weeks)</h2>
            
            <h3>Questionnaire Development</h3>
            <p>Following the project kickoff meeting, I gained clear insights into client expectations for the final deliverable. My preparation activities included:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Creating a comprehensive scheduling framework using Airtable</li>
                <li>Developing questionnaire guidelines and structure</li>
                <li>Crafting a detailed discussion guide for ethnographic sessions</li>
                <li>Conducting competitive analysis research for benchmark insights</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="insight-box">
                <p><strong>Data Quality in Large-Scale Surveys:</strong> Online surveys require robust quality measures, including analysis of straightlined responses in multiple-choice questions, implementation of attention-check questions to ensure genuine engagement, and pathway analysis to distinguish authentic from automated responses.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Data Collection (3 weeks)</h2>
            <p>Understanding users' portal interactions, daily contexts, and underlying needs was essential for identifying specific pain points. I conducted ethnographic interviews to capture rich user insights, taking detailed paper notes while recording sessions with professional audio equipment to preserve emotional nuances that might be missed in real-time observation.</p>
            
            <p>For survey data, I maintained strict quality control by documenting the complete user flow and question logic, tracking various user pathways through Excel to ensure proper question sequencing and response validation.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Data Analysis (2 weeks)</h2>
            <p><em class="emphasis">I synthesized both qualitative and quantitative findings into 30+ actionable insights organized by themes and comparative analysis.</em></p>
            
            <h3>Data Organization and Statistical Analysis</h3>
            <p>Quantitative data was segmented by respondent demographics and user groups, organized into banner and tab specifications, and processed through Q Research Software. I conducted significance testing at 90% and 95% confidence levels across total sample and specific demographic indexes.</p>
            
            <h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
            <p>Qualitative data underwent systematic thematic coding. Ethnographic video recordings were organized into 5 primary categories, each containing 2 subcategories, followed by cross-category similarity and difference analysis. Open-ended survey responses were similarly coded and mapped to corresponding quantitative response patterns.</p>
            <p>The two images below are examples of how collected data was pulled from specific databases. </p>

            <h3>Strategic Planning</h3>
            <p>Post-collection, I developed an analytical framework connecting quantitative and qualitative insights to key business recommendations, outlining specific focus areas and implementation strategies for the final client presentation.</p>

            <h2>User Journey Mapping (1 week)</h2>
            <p><em class="emphasis">Using key insights, I created comprehensive user journey maps and developed three distinct user personas representing the platform's primary demographics.</em></p>
            
            <h3>Journey Mapping Process</h3>
            <p>I developed a detailed interaction map for the current online platform integrated within the company's website. Using survey pathway data, I identified 6 critical decision points across 4 distinct user journey stages, illustrating various user routes and their underlying motivations.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Final Deliverable (1 week)</h2>
            <p>I created a comprehensive 50+ slide presentation deck designed to drive business decisions and strategic impact. My approach prioritized creating a clear narrative structure using quantitative and qualitative insights, with careful attention to data visualization accessibility for both technical and business audiences.</p>
            
            <p><em class="emphasis">The presentation was designed for universal comprehension, ensuring stakeholders from business, technology, and design backgrounds could easily understand and act upon the findings.</em></p>

            <h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
            <p>As a client-facing UX researcher, I successfully navigated project challenges while delivering impactful, actionable recommendations that resulted in:</p>
